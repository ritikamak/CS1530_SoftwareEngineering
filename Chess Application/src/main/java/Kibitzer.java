/**
 * This class implements the automated kibitzer functionality.
 * Creates a "Threaded Kibitzer"- a text box that provides random advice
 * and comments to the user. Text box refreshes and random intervals
 * (anywhere from 1 to 5 second long intervals) for the entire duration 
 * of the program's run. Provides random chess-related commentary.
 *
 * Extends Thread superclass.
 * Starts a separate thread which updates the text box.
